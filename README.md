🚀 Project Title: DeepPing: Intelligent Sonar Signal Classifier
🌟 Tagline:
AI-powered detection of underwater objects using sonar signals. Rock or Mine? DeepPing knows.

📖 Project Overview:
DeepPing is an AI-based sonar signal classification system designed to differentiate between rocks and underwater mines using sonar frequency returns. Powered by machine learning, it processes sonar data and predicts object type, helping in underwater navigation and safety systems.

The system leverages a Logistic Regression model trained on sonar dataset signals and offers an intuitive prediction output based on input sonar readings.

📊 Tech Stack:
Languages: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn

Model: Logistic Regression

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

🔍 Features:
Classifies sonar signals as Rock or Mine.

Uses Logistic Regression for efficient binary classification.

Accepts custom sonar readings for real-time predictions.

Designed for easy integration with web interfaces (future extension).

Clean, minimal Python code implementation in Jupyter Notebook.
