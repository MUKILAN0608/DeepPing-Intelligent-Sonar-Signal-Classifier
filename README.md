# ðŸš€ DeepPing: Intelligent Sonar Signal Classifier

### ðŸŒŸ AI-powered detection of underwater objects using sonar signals. Rock or Mine? DeepPing knows.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

DeepPing is a machine learning-based sonar signal classifier built with Python and Scikit-learn. It predicts whether an underwater object is a **Rock** or a **Mine** by analyzing sonar signals. The model is trained on the classic Sonar dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
